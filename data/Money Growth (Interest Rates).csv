0,Low interest rate,"Notice that the drop in interest rate of 0.8% in saving accounts. GXS just come out with a reason to say many consumers want a increase in interest rate in main accounts as most of their funds are there to get the 1.2x points for dash and grab spending. Hence they decrease the interest rate to 2.68% in saving account and increase to 2.38% in main account .

The thing is GXS can increase the main account interest and maintain the interest rate in saving account. They will attract more consumer in this case. However, they use this opportunity to decease the interest rate in saving account instead and use the consumer as an excuse for the decrease.

I am very disappointed in GXS and have close my account in GXS. There are other banks offering a higher interest rate such as OCBC and UOB for saving accounts. No point sticking to GXS."
1,Low interest rate,Itâ€™s all good! Until recently a dropped of 0.8% interest rate in such a short notice and changes
2,Low interest rate,first bank to reduce interest rates for savings but interest rates for loans stay high
3,Low interest rate,Worst rate you will ever find. Bank interest are much more forgiving. This app calculate and told me about 8.5% Per/annum. Total outrageous. That's close to ah long rate . Horrible horrible. Straight away uninstalled
4,Low interest rate,"3.48% interest rate only last for 2weeks, the main selling point for this app is now dropped to 2.68% pa ðŸ˜‚"
5,Low interest rate,Lousy. High interest rate. Not advertise as stated in the media. Scam.
6,Poor customer service,"Closed my account without giving me any reason. Just started to put money in the account to earn interest, merely only earned $4 of interest in total."
7,Buggy app,"Buggy app, bad interest rate"
8,Buggy app,Hang when i want to log in with sing pass
9,Buggy app,Cannot tap on Join The Revolution or anything
10,Buggy app,The links after downloading the app are unclickable to even register. Looks more like a wireframe on a Marvel platform. Lol What a great UX that GXS promises in their marketing but unable to deliver. I wonder what happens if you cannot click in future to transfer your money? I have serious doubts about how legit they are about Fintech with such a haphazard launch.
11,Lack of features,"Useless, lacks features and does not provide any improvement from traditional banks available in Singapore"
12,Lack of features,Lack the basic function to save a payee
13,Lack of features,"The overall design of the app is great, but the CNY banner looks so out of place in the latest version"
14,High minimum balance requirement,Overall is a good app? Just that why maximum cash is 5k? Make it 20k with higher interest rate
15,Difficulties in registering,"Registering, get the notice it's full and sign for interest. Received email notification, sign up to get prompt to sign for interest...again."
16,Lack of support for SGQR,"No support for SGQR. When only way to spend is QR pay, atleast support SGQR, GrabPay as very few business have Paynow QR!"
17,Confusing user interface,"Easy to set up and smooth sign in + attractive interest rate, it would be great if the saving caps could be higher than $5000 :)"
18,Confusing user interface,"The overall design of the app is great, but the CNY banner looks so out of place in the latest version"
19,Reduction in interest rates,"Just found out that they are reducing their interest rate to a pathetic 2.68%. don't like this bait and switch marketing strategy, lure us with high interest rate then suddenly drop the interest rates once they get enough sign ups. [Update] Whats the point of increasing the main wallet interest when no one puts money there? Its not like you're increasing it back to 3.48% right? The pt is the big reduction of the Pockets interest rates which is the key thing that people arent happy about."

37,Others,Great bank..Good interest rate
38,Others,Already 1 year but basic functions like adding payee is not in the app. Itâ€™s so troublesome to transfer funds to different bank accounts! With your latest move to reduce interest to 2.68% has made me feels like maribank is better even with slightly lower interest rate because they knows what basic functions to include in the app
39,Others,Simple to use. Took a short while to know how to process. Hope that they can maintain the great interest. Good job GXS.
40,Others,"Wish more people can download and use, and more rewards can be given."
41,Others,"Great app that can park your savings using pockets, but hopefully the interest rate of the savings pockets will increase due to the current economic conditions"
