0,Difficulties with login forgot password,"Unable to login or use the forgot password function. System only replied with ""something wrong please try again later"" Now I was told I must wait for the next version of app to be rolled out progressively before I can login. Hopefully won't take too long"
1,Difficulties with login forgot password,Worst apps everything also no resolve well
2,Lack of customer support,Worst apps everything also no resolve well
3,Confusion about app authenticity,Is this really an authentic app for GXS? Looks cheap.
4,Poor user experience,"Dumbest banking app ever. Get your own people to put 5*, never seen such app before, if you are good then make the app good and give 3.48%"
5,Poor user experience,Worst apps everything also no resolve well
6,Issues with deposit function,Honestly is my first time depositing digital banking A lot worry . But at the end is a great experience. I believe a lot of us wanted is the return . And they offer very high interest. Will continue to deposit Thank you
7,Issues with deposit function,"Been using this bank for a while now and didn't face any major problems. What I enjoyed the most is the saving pockets area where we could create different pockets for each saving we want to do and even add goals into it. The 2.68% per annum is added daily (0.01) as long as you have a minimum of 150 in your savings. If not, you'll have to wait till your it accumulates up to 0.01 to be added. There was also cashback when you make payment using the card which I didn't know till recently."
8,High interest rates,"The deposit interest is very high, which is currently my most satisfactory"
9,Limited functionality,"I wish we can put a 0 star for it. Make you create an account, wait for it only to tell you that it is full while others cut queue to have the account created while you continue to wait. Probably just out to farm your data. Dont bother"
10,Complaints about staff asking for positive reviews,"When you asked your staff to write a 5* review, don’t just get them to write great app, easy to use or hurray. Write how did the app help you, how you benefit from the app and why the app is soooo good?"
11,No option for zero star rating,"I wish we can put a 0 star for it. Make you create an account, wait for it only to tell you that it is full while others cut queue to have the account created while you continue to wait. Probably just out to farm your data. Dont bother"
12,Others,"I have to say that the UI/UX is one of the best one I’ll have seen for any Digibank mobile app and finally a strong market player that focuses on customer experience and design, which is critical as most banking products doesn’t differ much for any banks out there. Please make it available asap can’t wait to see what you have to offer!"
13,Others,"Very easy to use, user friendly and intuitive. Nice design of the app making it easier to navigate the app. Saving pocket is an interesting and useful feature. can’t wait to explore and use more of the app"
14,Others,"The app’s interface is really user friendly and sleek! It loads very fast as well, can’t wait to start using this digital bank app :)"
15,Others,the app is easy to navigate and the UI/UX is excellent. I love the saving pockets and the good interest rates! definitely worth the wait and has a lot of potential 👍🏼
16,Others,My fav feature is the saving pockets can't wait to build my savings with the good interest rates. amazing user interface!
17,Others,No more long waits and tons of paperwork to open a bank account. Looking forward to how GXS can generate a stronger value proposition for consumers.
18,Others,Best digital bank in my opinion I prefer this over its competitors:)
19,Others,"Well if u like to see growth everyday, this app gives u that. Set goals and see it grow towards it!"
20,Others,"The app works great, simple yet effective enough to encourage savings via ""pockets"" so that users do not unknowingly overspent using the main account and that explain the lower interest as compared to funds kept inside the ""pockets"". Although its good to start small, i do hope the bank can increase the saving caps to encourage even more savings.Security wise while i think is on par with industry standard but there are still room to enhance it further as scammers are getting smarter everyday."
21,Others,"Love the interface and saving pocket is so unique, can’t wait to meet my deposit goal!"
22,Others,Nice app! Love the Saving pockets.
23,Others,"The app is super easy to use, and I love the saving pockets that allow me to easily set money aside for my goals!"
24,Others,best app experience looking forward for more breakthrough features in digi banking.
25,Others,Awesome experience so far. UI is flawless. Innovative ideas of various pockets and ROI caught my interest.
26,Others,This is very good. Really very helpful. I Will keep in touch with them. 👌🏽😍
27,Others,"Extremely disappointed after downloading the app, waited and waited for it to open and still told to wait and wait and wait and wait and wait……………..no ends!!!!!👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎"
28,Others,"Good to see increased competition in the banking space (high interest is good, but inexplicably only given within a saving pocket), but GXS app lacks basic functionality, eg. ability to save payees (at the point of writing this review, these details need to be re-input each time - irritating and error prone). Suggest that rather than working on cool, but otherwise non-essential functions (like saving pockets), the company should focus on the basics first."
29,Others,"Not prepared? Then don’t launch. See your direct competitor got a pure breeze of experience. Onboarding was swift and fast. Just think the reviews here are just made by the staff lol, focusing on UI/UX what a joke. Best UI/UX where others cannot experience YET."
30,Others,Love the savings pockets and daily interest!
31,Others,"Great experience. Setup, top up, setup pocket and transfer smoothly"
32,Others,Great features! Love it!
33,Others,"Love the function of having multiple pockets as it helps me to track each target accordingly. Thank you for the genius allocation! Would have given 4.5 if there was, with the 0.5 hoping for unlimited numbers of pockets. :"")"
34,Others,Easy to register and deposit. Clean UI interface.
