0,Poor login functionality,Having problems logging onto the app. It says my phone cannot be used for GXS as it has been modified in someway. I just logged in this morning with the same phone with no problems. Please advice.
1,Poor login functionality,App got problem can't login
2,Poor login functionality,Occasionally getting unable to login error.
3,Poor login functionality,"Screen loaded but when no response when I press ""I have an account"""
4,Fingerprint login not working,Fingerprint login no longer work since 2 months back.. all other bank apps doesn't have such issues.
5,Unclear error messages,"Doesn't work after login page, freezea"
6,Terrible user experience,"Terrible experience. Took 4 attempts to finally set up account. Previous 3x received error msg ""couldn't approve your account at this time"". When the account was finally set up a few hours later, the app crashed. Have restarted the phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I'm still stuck at the first page after logging in, which seemed to have a popped up msg/ad but not loading. Then the error msg of ""app is not responding"" appeared and prompted me to close the app."
7,Terrible user experience,Not ready to roll out completely. Aint even allowed to create an account without an invitation
8,Lack of transparency,Not worth the effort to sign up. Not transparent in application selection process.
9,Issues with interest rates,"Noticed the news writing they offer 3.48% interest rate. After downloading the apps and trying to sign up, end up asked me to fill up my particular to  receive latest buzz updates.! 

If the bank isn‚Äôt planing to offer, please stop advertising that. Thanks!"
10,Issues with interest rates,I hope the GXS Bank can given the interest 10% p.a as deposit $1 into the saving account as a free gift .
11,Difficulty in signing up,Not so good im not citizent or pr but ipen saving account also can not
12,Compatibility issues,Can't even click log in on galaxy s23 ultra
13,Compatibility issues,Hi please take note your app shouldn't be detecting whether if my phone has a pin number or not. This is a red flag on your digital banking system. No other bank is doing this including Trust Bank who is your competitor and they are doing better than you. Btw do not insult Singtel share holders like me.
14,Occasional errors,"Love the function of having multiple pockets as it helps me to track each target accordingly. Thank you for the genius allocation! Would have given 4.5 if there was, with the 0.5 hoping for unlimited numbers of pockets. :"")"
15,Occasional errors,It's seemless banking experience
16,Delayed response,Kudos to GXS for responding promptly to the error that I experienced accessing the pockets. The latest update resolved the problem. Thank you!
17,Confusing user interface,"Looking at past review and after installing the app, I must say the effort to launch progressively paid off instead of rushing into it. Was kind of concern if this is going to take off but I guess the objective is to ensure a safe bankng experience rather than rushing to grab the market. No observable bug and smooth sign in process."
18,Others,Great banking app with attractive interest rates! Please allow us to add and/or save payees so we don‚Äôt have to keep typing out UEN numbers or account numbers. Would be nice to be able to add the debit card to Apple Pay too!!
19,Others,"A bank like no other, no bank have such amazing feature to separate your money into different ‚Äúpockets‚Äù to keep track of your goals. Moreover the interest rate they give is the highest for the no effort! Interest are being deposit daily and it‚Äôs amazing to see üíµ coming in to the bank daily! 

The user interfaces is so intuitive that every button can be found with your eyes close, that makes money transfer so much smoother. Also the colours is so slick that I want to turn the app on everyday just to look at it and see the daily interest

Lots of potential for the product and I can‚Äôt wait to see more of it."
20,Others,"Well if u like to see growth everyday, this app gives u that. Set goals and see it grow towards it!"
21,Others,"Why put an app on the store when you are not ready. All about the app now is collecting info. If you have heard yet, please use testflight for ur ‚Äòlaunch‚Äô aka beta testing ü§¶üèª

Update: doesn‚Äôt bode well‚Ä¶ even response is so robotic n mundane. Might as well not respond and spend the time to build the app for a proper launch"
22,Others,"I have to say that the UI/UX is one of the best one I‚Äôll have seen for any Digibank mobile app and finally a strong market player that focuses on customer experience and design, which is critical as most banking products doesn‚Äôt differ much for any banks out there. Please make it available asap can‚Äôt wait to see what you have to offer!"
23,Others,"Good to see increased competition in the banking space (high interest is good, but inexplicably only given within a saving pocket), but GXS app lacks basic functionality, eg. ability to save payees (at the point of writing this review, these details need to be re-input each time - irritating and error prone). Suggest that rather than working on cool, but otherwise non-essential functions (like saving pockets), the company should focus on the basics first."
24,Others,"Pls improve your good service for any person who are really need it,hope the app can improve soon"
25,Others,Honestly is my first time depositing digital banking A lot worry . But at the end is a great experience. I believe a lot of us wanted is the return . And they offer very high interest. Will continue to deposit Thank you
26,Others,"It doesn‚Äôt make the company look reputable when they offer a high interest rate only to drop it immediately after gaining enough users. It feels like a bait, which it is. They should acquire deposits through more honest and transparent methods."
27,Others,Unexpected error when trying to login. Kindly fix this issue ASAP.
28,Others,"Fair and transparent loans.
Interest is not like the atypical bank that is out to profit and cripple the debtor."
29,Others,Great plat form ‚Ä¶ easy to use and hassle free.
30,Others,"Extremely disappointed with the GXS app. Despite consistent use on the same device for a long time, it suddenly stopped allowing money transfers with explanation device changed. This lack of clarity and abrupt disruption in service is unacceptable. Terrible user experience, deserves only 1 star."
31,Others,reliable and quick response
32,Others,"The UIUX of the app is definitely the best amongst the banks right now, looking forward to more products"
