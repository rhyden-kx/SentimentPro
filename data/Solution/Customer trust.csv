7,Crashing freezing,"Once login, it just hang there and when try to use it in grab app it just say that my phone unable to use this app"
8,Crashing freezing,Intuitive and User-Friendly Interface. No doubt there are further improvements to be made. Looking forward to what the digital banking scene has to offer! Suggestion to have an interface/section for users to offer feedback & suggestions for potential pain points/improvements.
9,Unable to cancel delete personal details,How to cancel or delete all my personal detail submit on GXS app thru Singpass?
10,Misleading advertising,"Misleading advertisement for flexiloan promotion for July 2023, stated rate as low as 2.99% p.a. Issued a rate that was extraordinary and way beyond all major banks that would offered even at their highest peak rate. A real shock of disbelief, thinking was a sign-up bug but it ended to be their best rate offered. Would be really cautious on signing up any offers from GXS even though their app user interface, interaction, and wording do project confidence in honoring their offer."
11,Issues with Flexiloan,Gxs Flexiloan doesn't work even though I meet the eligible criteria..
12,Issues with Flexiloan,Good to have the UI updated. Only issue now is the 5k max deposit.
13,Lack of customer support,"Dumbest banking app ever. Get your own people to put 5*, never seen such app before, if you are good then make the app good and give 3.48%"
14,Lack of customer support,App is snappy. Interface is simple and straightforward. Most importantly interest is attractive. Keep it up! By the way please add 'Save payee' feature.
