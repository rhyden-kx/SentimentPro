0,Long waiting list,"1) long waiting list 2) everytime i log into waiting list, it's as if I'm not in the waiting list as they ask me to sign up to be in the waiting list ðŸ™„ alr 4 time alr 3) of course I'm still not in the GXS list Had sent light for the long wait. Meanwhile while it isn't approved I'll delete since I won't be able to use it. ðŸ˜‘ No spaces."
1,Difficulty in signing up,When I sign up canâ€™t sign up always say oops something went wrong please try again
2,Difficulty in signing up,Deleted the app. Sick of it serving no other purpose currently than being a lead generator.

4,Difficulty in signing up,Cui full. Cannot sign up. Only on waiting list. What a waste.
5,Difficulty in signing up,"Everytime successfully signec up, after log in numerours time, it told me ""we have lost you in space"". Poor online banking"
6,High interest rates,"Reduced interest from 3.48 to 2.68% in less than a month, kenna baited to start an account here. Have removed all my funds and closed my account."
7,High interest rates,No debit card. Max interest reduced to only 2.65 now within one month of start.
8,High interest rates,"Only Singaporean can apply for loan, good if everyone can apply."
9,High interest rates,"The deposit interest is very high, which is currently my most satisfactory"
10,Technical glitches,When to sign up for the account in last year august. 5 months has pass still waiting. Please help to solve the issue.
11,Technical glitches,What a nonsense app is this??download but say got malware in my hp?and ask me to fix my app?wth?
12,Technical glitches,"Seriously makes you wonder how grab and singtel took so long to come up with an app and there is no simple things like adding a payee. The debit card was only recently released when trust came up with a proper product more than a year ago with a proper rewards programme. Just like its owners, GXS is a failure."
13,Technical glitches,"Why do the app ask me to rate on Play Store if my rating on the app is 5, but there was no such questions when I put a 1 rating on the app? It encourages unfair ratings on the Play Store."
14,Technical glitches,"Reminder, please up to date your app for users to activate Gxs debit physical card. Currently facing a small issue with logging in my GXS app & only through the app. + 5 secret digit number to input. All the best to new peeps have same trouble as me.... Cheers."
15,Technical glitches,Been waiting since july to open an account.. Remembered that i sign up for early access first time round and was told would be informed once new slots are available for sign up.. As weeks goes by i see that other people were invited to open an account but not me.. Now 4 mths later am trying again and signed up again for early access..
16,Limited eligibility for loans,"Only Singaporean can apply for loan, good if everyone can apply."
17,Lack of transparency,Easy to apply good full amount of loan given compare to outside or lending bee ... or they never cut your loan amouny . interest can be save if payment early. multiple loan also can.. only it could be better if can increase loan amount after loan given .. or can be resgistet again once deleted.
18,Redundant features,Totally absurd and redundant feature that FORCES me to setup a PASSWORD FOR MY PHONE!!! The same kind autocracy and authoritarianism they force down the throat of their delivery riders. I've got at least 3 other banking apps by major banks. NONE.. I repeat .. NONE forces me to modify my phone settings to accommodate them. I'm steering away from this app.
19,Payment issues,"I was trying to make payment using Paynow Qr code using scan and pay. Merchant create a dynamic QR code of payment $15.7 but the GXS app scan and pay read in as $15.07
Pls advice to correct the mistake as it make me and merchant very inconvenience."
20,Absence of debit card,No debit card. Max interest reduced to only 2.65 now within one month of start.
21,Misleading app behavior,After few day on decided whether to download the app I decided to went on But the said thing is once I'm try to log in the account ðŸ˜­ but couldn't log on and it said to rest ask to go back to the front page.
22,Others,Reduce interest rate in less than a month. Waste time open account here.
23,Others,Have not even tried already failed on me. Just to download has the error and ask to download again .. ðŸ˜”
