0,Seamless integration not available on iPad,"21 Jul 23:
The integration on iPad is off. The first time login requires SingPass as a safety feature but it doesn‚Äôt generate a QR Code. Devs should consider a workaround. 

Pending dev feedback before rating change."
1,Difficulty opening app,"Unable to open app. From other reviews, seems I am not the only one. How to trust this bank?"
2,Difficulty opening app,digital bank app does not work when it already goes live.....are u still doing UAT?
3,Unclear purpose of app,What is the purpose of your app? Why would I use your app over DBS uob and ocbc? I don't see why you are better in any way?
4,Issues with Singpass details,App is not clear and Singpass details are not accurate for them. It didn't allow me to open an account....
5,Issues with Singpass details,"blank screen after they pull all my Singpass data. terrible digi bank, waste of time. taking my money to other banks. my phone is updated, latest OS, not jailbroken, all official and secure."
6,Overlapping wording,Over lapping wording. Pull down refresh need to tweak more does not feel smooth it all. Opening of account does not work if you are connected to WiFi.
7,Poor interface design on mobile,"Over all good,but some interface cover on mobile phone.Thank."
8,Difficulty raising deposit cap,Easy to use. Hopefully can raise the deposit cap soon.
9,Time wasting verification process,"Really really damm time wasting, if not ready for sign up don't launch. Close down and don't let people wait for you, uninstalling now. Trust Bank is much better, CRAB!"
10,Lack of availability on Google Play Store,Love GxS bank. Would it be available on Google Pay as well? üòâ
11,Inability to delete fake accounts,Keep creating account to write fake 5 star reviews when your app is so buggy and processing time is so slow. Worst banking app ever!
12,Confusing account creation process,Gave an application to open account but the bank decided to cancel opening new accounts and the ‚Äúbank‚Äù didnt even bother to inform clients! May be its a gods sign to save my money.
13,Difficulty reducing transaction amounts,Show allow to increase amount not reduce and stay that way. For a first timer I didn‚Äôt know that once I reduce amt I cannot get back the original amount that is given to me.
14,No option to increase transaction amounts,Show allow to increase amount not reduce and stay that way. For a first timer I didn‚Äôt know that once I reduce amt I cannot get back the original amount that is given to me.
15,Poor customer service compared to banks,Such a great service compared to Bank
16,Issues with user interface,Very easy to navigate and super fluid UI. Lovely bank and recommended everyone to join with ease of mind.
17,Issues with user interface,"Gxs is simple and easy to use, with a saving account/pocket that has no TnC. But not being able to add payees for FAST transfer is quite a setback and detrimental considering it as a basic common banking service that most people do. As a digital bank, isn't it pertinent to include basic online banking service like adding of payee?"
18,Difficulty paying before due date,"Ease of use.
Pay anytime before due is possible. 
Emergency moolahs are here without breaking your bank!"
19,Blank screen issue,"blank screen after they pull all my Singpass data. terrible digi bank, waste of time. taking my money to other banks. my phone is updated, latest OS, not jailbroken, all official and secure."
20,Color scheme appreciated,Loving the color scheme!
21,Invite requested,Looks cool and sleek! Can I get an invite if I give a five star review? ü§™
22,Difficulty with pull down refresh,Over lapping wording. Pull down refresh need to tweak more does not feel smooth it all. Opening of account does not work if you are connected to WiFi.
23,Others,"One of the worst app I ever installed. Such a proclaimed digital bank yet can't even get the app to work properly. Since day one till now after sign up, the app never works, keep stating slip-space. If you can't get the app work properly, then don't launch it. How to trust and put our money in such an app if it doesn't even work properly. Trust app is so much better."
24,Others,"GXS offers seamless, fast and super effective digital services. 
Never ever I had such experience with other banks. GXS definitely is the bank of future! 
You must try it to believe!"
25,Others,"THIS LITERALLY SAVED ME, i recommendation is high as the giant touches the sky"
26,Others,"You are welcome! I had hoped to keep more money long term but after only 1 month with GXS, your interest rate dropped greatly! Please have ""Add Payee"" to reduce errors - no Copy & Paste so we need to memorise long account numbers! Jul2023 Review - Seamless transactions. Great fun bank to bank with. I like the pockets idea where I am able to see where my goals are heading! The interest is the icing on the cake! Great UI and UX! Easiest digital bank to use! Thank you very much, Dev & Team!"
27,Others,"Like this app over Trust and others. Concept similar to Timo bank in VN which I used before when I was living there. 5k account limit is shocking to me since these days where got people only save 5k. Hope for an update on this asap as well as debit card. Otherwise, interface is clean, easy to use, easy to sign up, good interest rate. For now, gxs looks promising to be my permanent savings bank. Others will just serve as my Spent account or salary credit account."
