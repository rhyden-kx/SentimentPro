0,Difficulty logging in,"Unable to login or use the forgot password function. System only replied with ""something wrong please try again later"" Now I was told I must wait for the next version of app to be rolled out progressively before I can login. Hopefully won't take too long"
1,Difficulty logging in,"Wasn't able to log in since 7 Sept. Called the CSO hotline on 9 Sept and was told to try resending the email OTP. Checked the email junk box and retried multiple times but didn't receive any emails. Was told that they had to check on the back end. When asked when I could receive a response, they mentioned 2 working days?? But this means I wouldn't be able to carry out any transactions for 5 whole days. Imagine if I had a critical transaction to carry out! I would have no access to my funds!!!!"

5,Unable to set up account,"After signed up and asked for my info,straight away got rejected!"
6,Poor customer support,Buggy app and bad customer support
7,Poor customer support,"Disappointing app experience, awful faux friendly service. I was invited to join via Grab. After multiple painful attempts to sign up (and v lacklustre UI/UX), I was told that there's been an error, and finally received a vague email stating that I am ineligible, without offering any reason why. After multiple emails, customer service still failed to explain why I am not eligible, while signing off as my 'GXS buddy' everytime. I don't need a buddy from you. I just need you to do your job."

10,Buggy app,"The screen cannot respond entirely.. After going through the screen login, the app completely doesn't respond touch. Very buggy."

12,Frustration with error messages,DO NOT USE THIS APP!!!! So frustrating on this app. 3 times I tried to move a small portion of money out of my pocket. 3 times the pocket becomes $0 straight away and I can’t move/transfer my money out!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13,Frustration with error messages,"App keeps giving me “something went wrong” and “it’s not you, it’s us” notification whenever I attempt to log-in. Totally unusually at this time of writing."
14,Frustration with error messages,Can GXS pls explain why the app keeps saying there is unexpected error and I cannot even open the app????
15,Singpass registration issues,For 1st time registration signup by singpass and all info's needed but still my application is denied.
16,Inability to use the app on certain devices,Cannot set up my account in redmi 8T. Reach the email 2FA before I key in the numbers App closed
17,Inability to use the app on certain devices,"The screen cannot respond entirely.. After going through the screen login, the app completely doesn't respond touch. Very buggy."
18,Delayed email responses,"Poor, get in touch with email late response after few weeks then replied. Not recommending 😔"
19,Lack of readiness for users,The bank is not ready at all. I'm your ecosystem user. This is how you treat you ecosystem customer.
20,Others,"The app works great, simple yet effective enough to encourage savings via ""pockets"" so that users do not unknowingly overspent using the main account and that explain the lower interest as compared to funds kept inside the ""pockets"". Although its good to start small, i do hope the bank can increase the saving caps to encourage even more savings.Security wise while i think is on par with industry standard but there are still room to enhance it further as scammers are getting smarter everyday."
21,Others,"Sending money into my GXS account is a breeze and instantaneous - regardless of the amounts. I’m able to immediately see that my funds are in GXS. 

Transferring money OUT is a huge issue. Since June I’ve had problems transferring amounts higher than $500 back to my other banking accounts, each time a red banner will pop up and said something went wrong please try again later. TODAY I can’t transfer more than $1000 back to myself - even the $1000 had to be transferred in TWO transactions of $500 each. Customer service officers did their best to help each time but it’s annoying that the advice provided (killing the app, re-logging in with SingPass) still don’t work."
22,Others,Nice app! Love the Saving pockets.
23,Others,"Updated - Kindly ignore my previous rating, and I have amended my rating. My son did a Giro to link his Grab Account to GXS but neglected to inform us of the transaction."
24,Others,"The app is super easy to use, and I love the saving pockets that allow me to easily set money aside for my goals!"
25,Others,Hi any chance for foreign to apply? Im work at sg
26,Others,Easy to use and nice UIUX. Saving pockets is an interesting and useful feature
27,Others,"Been using this bank for a while now and didn't face any major problems. What I enjoyed the most is the saving pockets area where we could create different pockets for each saving we want to do and even add goals into it. The 2.68% per annum is added daily (0.01) as long as you have a minimum of 150 in your savings. If not, you'll have to wait till your it accumulates up to 0.01 to be added. There was also cashback when you make payment using the card which I didn't know till recently."
28,Others,Love the savings pockets and daily interest!
29,Others,the app is easy to navigate and the UI/UX is excellent. I love the saving pockets and the good interest rates! definitely worth the wait and has a lot of potential 👍🏼
30,Others,"Extremely disappointed after downloading the app, waited and waited for it to open and still told to wait and wait and wait and wait and wait……………..no ends!!!!!👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎"
