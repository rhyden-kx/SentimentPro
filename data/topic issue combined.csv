App Responsiveness,0,Difficulties in account registration,"Is GXS looking into this issue? Going to be a week, still something is wrong. What happened to iOS user testing before roll out? Itâ€™s baffling the slow service recovery GXS is impressing upon iOS users."
App Responsiveness,1,Difficulties in account registration,"Cannot register, keep nothing pop up On sign up"
App Responsiveness,2,Difficulties in account registration,"Stuck on Oops, something went wrong page when opening the app, while overseas. I can't imagine if I was in a urgent situation and my banking app failed like this. No way to access funds through a browser too means you can't do anything at all other than hope the problem is fixed soon. Put what you can afford to lose."
App Responsiveness,3,Difficulties in account registration,"Cannot seem to open the app suddenly. Did not install new apps or change any setting on phone. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling still no avail. Although your CSO has been trying to rectify, it is still unsolvable. Sad, as when it first came out, I was the one of the many who applied in the beginning stage. Your services helped me. But now I have no access to it."
App Responsiveness,4,Difficulties in account registration,I seem to be having issues with the opening of the app.
App Responsiveness,5,Difficulties in account registration,Seamless registration. All done in less than 15 mins. Signed up and funds loaded. I guess they improved the app compared to the issues faced by other users earlier on.
App Responsiveness,6,Difficulties in account registration,I can't seem to register!!!!
App Responsiveness,7,Issues with loan application and approval process,This is very good. Really very helpful. I Will keep in touch with them. ðŸ‘ŒðŸ½ðŸ˜
App Responsiveness,8,Issues with loan application and approval process,"What is the criteria to approve the loan? Each time my hubby and I tried to apply loan multiple time, it get rejected. I wonder how much do we need to earn every month to get the loan approved!! If you have some rules and criteria then state it out so people won't waste time applying."
App Responsiveness,9,Issues with loan application and approval process,I have merely tried to apply for your flexi loan on this app. But when i tried to applied like 9 times straight i have been instantly being asked to reapply over and over again. Very bad for user experience and does not live up to expectations till today
App Responsiveness,10,Issues with loan application and approval process,Whats with the Loan Thingy ???
App Responsiveness,11,Slow transfer speed and connectivity problems,"Hit with fast reversal when transferring money to this gxs bank, first time in my life a fast transfer didnâ€™t succeed. Googled for recent reviews and social media on this gxs bank. Mostly bad reviews and issues. I donâ€™t need developer reply to my review here as Iâ€™m absolutely not going to touch this bank anymore. And biggest joke of all, you donâ€™t even have the most basic banking feature to save payee details. What kind of app development staff and quality is that???"
App Responsiveness,12,Slow transfer speed and connectivity problems,Quick transfers to bank acc and fast repayments. Very suitable for short term loans
App Responsiveness,13,Lack of certain features such as bank transfer,"Have been waiting for a slot for the account since GXS started and have been waiting until now (about 7 months) and still nothing, whenever anyone ask for why, the excuses given are still mostly the same with no actual changes or improvements (people canâ€™t help but compare to the other bank â€œtrust bank Singaporeâ€ that also launched just 1 day before GXSâ€™s launch and believe trust bank Singapore to be better since trust bank can allow people to register without waiting for this long)"
App Responsiveness,14,Lack of certain features such as bank transfer,Almost perfect; I want to transfer via bank account number but they do no allow me to save the bank details so I'm stuck twitch manually entering the details everytime when I need to do transfer which can be prone to human error.
App Responsiveness,15,Poor customer service,"Is GXS looking into this issue? Going to be a week, still something is wrong. What happened to iOS user testing before roll out? Itâ€™s baffling the slow service recovery GXS is impressing upon iOS users."

App Responsiveness,17,Difficulties in navigating the app,The app is easy to navigate and optimise for people of all ages.
App Responsiveness,18,Bugs and glitches in the app,"Simple, straightforward to use with no bugs. Great experience"
App Responsiveness,19,Lack of clear instructions or error messages,"What a joke! Nothing happens after you input your phone number - nothing! 

Itâ€™ll be so much, and I donâ€™t exaggerate when I say this, so much faster for you to travel from one end of Singapore to the other, to open an account at a traditional bank branch. 

One piece of advice to the management of GXS Bank - do not launch if you are not ready! You are a joke. Please look at Trust Bank. Simple and easy to use. Account opened in like, 2 mins?"
App Responsiveness,20,Lack of clear instructions or error messages,"Cannot seem to open the app suddenly. Did not install new apps or change any setting on phone. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling still no avail. Although your CSO has been trying to rectify, it is still unsolvable. Sad, as when it first came out, I was the one of the many who applied in the beginning stage. Your services helped me. But now I have no access to it."
App Responsiveness,21,Others,"Great app, with awesome design and theme unlike traditional banking institutions. Provide high interest rates and suitable for targeted group of audience. Ratings were probably dragged down by reviewers who rated 1/5 because they couldnâ€™t sign up - as GXS bank is rolling out to users by batches.

Overall a good experience! :)"
App Responsiveness,22,Others,"Not prepared? Then donâ€™t launch. See your direct competitor got a pure breeze of experience. Onboarding was swift and fast. Just think the reviews here are just made by the staff lol, focusing on UI/UX what a joke. Best UI/UX where others cannot experience YET."

Customer Services,0,Inability to save payments,"My biggest frustration is that I canâ€™t save payees when sending money.  Everytime I need to transfer funds, I have to select a transfer type and fully type out the account number, payeeâ€™s name, and select the bank.

Issued a rate that was extraordinary and way beyond all major banks that would offered even at their highest peak rate. A real shock of disbelief, thinking was a sign-up bug but it ended to be their best rate offered.

Login & Account Setup,1,Difficulty logging in,"Wasn't able to log in since 7 Sept. Called the CSO hotline on 9 Sept and was told to try resending the email OTP. Checked the email junk box and retried multiple times but didn't receive any emails. Was told that they had to check on the back end. When asked when I could receive a response, they mentioned 2 working days?? But this means I wouldn't be able to carry out any transactions for 5 whole days. Imagine if I had a critical transaction to carry out! I would have no access to my funds!!!!"

After multiple painful attempts to sign up (and v lacklustre UI/UX), I was told that there's been an error, and finally received a vague email stating that I am ineligible, without offering any reason why. After multiple emails, customer service still failed to explain why I am not eligible, while signing off as my 'GXS buddy' everytime. I don't need a buddy from you. I just need you to do your job."
Login & Account Setup,8,Buggy app,Buggy app and bad customer support
Login & Account Setup,9,Buggy app,Cant launch. Stalled at invisible layer. Then receive crashed notification.

Login & Account Setup,12,Frustration with error messages,DO NOT USE THIS APP!!!! So frustrating on this app. 3 times I tried to move a small portion of money out of my pocket. 3 times the pocket becomes $0 straight away and I canâ€™t move/transfer my money out!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Login & Account Setup,19,Lack of readiness for users,The bank is not ready at all. I'm your ecosystem user. This is how you treat you ecosystem customer.
Login & Account Setup,20,Others,"The app works great, simple yet effective enough to encourage savings via ""pockets"" so that users do not unknowingly overspent using the main account and that explain the lower interest as compared to funds kept inside the ""pockets"". Although its good to start small, i do hope the bank can increase the saving caps to encourage even more savings.Security wise while i think is on par with industry standard but there are still room to enhance it further as scammers are getting smarter everyday."
Login & Account Setup,21,Others,"Sending money into my GXS account is a breeze and instantaneous - regardless of the amounts. Iâ€™m able to immediately see that my funds are in GXS. 

Transferring money OUT is a huge issue. Since June Iâ€™ve had problems transferring amounts higher than $500 back to my other banking accounts, each time a red banner will pop up and said something went wrong please try again later. TODAY I canâ€™t transfer more than $1000 back to myself - even the $1000 had to be transferred in TWO transactions of $500 each. Customer service officers did their best to help each time but itâ€™s annoying that the advice provided (killing the app, re-logging in with SingPass) still donâ€™t work."
Login & Account Setup,22,Others,Nice app! Love the Saving pockets.
Login & Account Setup,23,Others,"Updated - Kindly ignore my previous rating, and I have amended my rating. My son did a Giro to link his Grab Account to GXS but neglected to inform us of the transaction."

Login & Account Setup,26,Others,Easy to use and nice UIUX. Saving pockets is an interesting and useful feature
Login & Account Setup,27,Others,"Been using this bank for a while now and didn't face any major problems. What I enjoyed the most is the saving pockets area where we could create different pockets for each saving we want to do and even add goals into it. The 2.68% per annum is added daily (0.01) as long as you have a minimum of 150 in your savings. If not, you'll have to wait till your it accumulates up to 0.01 to be added. There was also cashback when you make payment using the card which I didn't know till recently."
Login & Account Setup,28,Others,Love the savings pockets and daily interest!
Login & Account Setup,29,Others,the app is easy to navigate and the UI/UX is excellent. I love the saving pockets and the good interest rates! definitely worth the wait and has a lot of potential ðŸ‘ðŸ¼

Money Growth (Interest Rates),0,Low interest rate,"Notice that the drop in interest rate of 0.8% in saving accounts. GXS just come out with a reason to say many consumers want a increase in interest rate in main accounts as most of their funds are there to get the 1.2x points for dash and grab spending. Hence they decrease the interest rate to 2.68% in saving account and increase to 2.38% in main account .

The thing is GXS can increase the main account interest and maintain the interest rate in saving account. They will attract more consumer in this case. However, they use this opportunity to decease the interest rate in saving account instead and use the consumer as an excuse for the decrease.

I am very disappointed in GXS and have close my account in GXS. There are other banks offering a higher interest rate such as OCBC and UOB for saving accounts. No point sticking to GXS."
Money Growth (Interest Rates),1,Low interest rate,Itâ€™s all good! Until recently a dropped of 0.8% interest rate in such a short notice and changes
Money Growth (Interest Rates),2,Low interest rate,first bank to reduce interest rates for savings but interest rates for loans stay high

Money Growth (Interest Rates),10,Buggy app,The links after downloading the app are unclickable to even register. Looks more like a wireframe on a Marvel platform. Lol What a great UX that GXS promises in their marketing but unable to deliver. I wonder what happens if you cannot click in future to transfer your money? I have serious doubts about how legit they are about Fintech with such a haphazard launch.

Money Growth (Interest Rates),18,Confusing user interface,"The overall design of the app is great, but the CNY banner looks so out of place in the latest version"
Money Growth (Interest Rates),19,Reduction in interest rates,"Just found out that they are reducing their interest rate to a pathetic 2.68%. don't like this bait and switch marketing strategy, lure us with high interest rate then suddenly drop the interest rates once they get enough sign ups. [Update] Whats the point of increasing the main wallet interest when no one puts money there? Its not like you're increasing it back to 3.48% right? The pt is the big reduction of the Pockets interest rates which is the key thing that people arent happy about."

Money Growth (Interest Rates),38,Others,Already 1 year but basic functions like adding payee is not in the app. Itâ€™s so troublesome to transfer funds to different bank accounts! With your latest move to reduce interest to 2.68% has made me feels like maribank is better even with slightly lower interest rate because they knows what basic functions to include in the app
Money Growth (Interest Rates),39,Others,Simple to use. Took a short while to know how to process. Hope that they can maintain the great interest. Good job GXS.

Safety,17,Issues with user interface,"Gxs is simple and easy to use, with a saving account/pocket that has no TnC. But not being able to add payees for FAST transfer is quite a setback and detrimental considering it as a basic common banking service that most people do.

Since day one till now after sign up, the app never works, keep stating slip-space. If you can't get the app work properly, then don't launch it. How to trust and put our money in such an app if it doesn't even work properly. Trust app is so much better."

Safety,26,Others,"You are welcome! I had hoped to keep more money long term but after only 1 month with GXS, your interest rate dropped greatly! Please have ""Add Payee"" to reduce errors - no Copy & Paste so we need to memorise long account numbers! Jul2023 Review - Seamless transactions. Great fun bank to bank with. I like the pockets idea where I am able to see where my goals are heading! The interest is the icing on the cake! Great UI and UX! Easiest digital bank to use! Thank you very much, Dev & Team!"
Safety,27,Others,"Like this app over Trust and others. Concept similar to Timo bank in VN which I used before when I was living there. 5k account limit is shocking to me since these days where got people only save 5k. Hope for an update on this asap as well as debit card. Otherwise, interface is clean, easy to use, easy to sign up, good interest rate. For now, gxs looks promising to be my permanent savings bank. Others will just serve as my Spent account or salary credit account."

Services & Products,12,Technical glitches,"Seriously makes you wonder how grab and singtel took so long to come up with an app and there is no simple things like adding a payee. The debit card was only recently released when trust came up with a proper product more than a year ago with a proper rewards programme. Just like its owners, GXS is a failure."
Services & Products,13,Technical glitches,"Why do the app ask me to rate on Play Store if my rating on the app is 5, but there was no such questions when I put a 1 rating on the app? It encourages unfair ratings on the Play Store."

Services & Products,18,Redundant features,Totally absurd and redundant feature that FORCES me to setup a PASSWORD FOR MY PHONE!!! The same kind autocracy and authoritarianism they force down the throat of their delivery riders. I've got at least 3 other banking apps by major banks. NONE.. I repeat .. NONE forces me to modify my phone settings to accommodate them. I'm steering away from this app.
Services & Products,19,Payment issues,"I was trying to make payment using Paynow Qr code using scan and pay. Merchant create a dynamic QR code of payment $15.7 but the GXS app scan and pay read in as $15.07

When the account was finally set up a few hours later, the app crashed.

Then the error msg of ""app is not responding"" appeared and prompted me to close the app."
User Interface,7,Terrible user experience,Not ready to roll out completely. Aint even allowed to create an account without an invitation
User Interface,8,Lack of transparency,Not worth the effort to sign up. Not transparent in application selection process.
User Interface,9,Issues with interest rates,"Noticed the news writing they offer 3.48% interest rate. After downloading the apps and trying to sign up, end up asked me to fill up my particular to  receive latest buzz updates.! 

If the bank isnâ€™t planing to offer, please stop advertising that. Thanks!"
User Interface,10,Issues with interest rates,I hope the GXS Bank can given the interest 10% p.a as deposit $1 into the saving account as a free gift .
User Interface,11,Difficulty in signing up,Not so good im not citizent or pr but ipen saving account also can not
User Interface,12,Compatibility issues,Can't even click log in on galaxy s23 ultra
User Interface,13,Compatibility issues,Hi please take note your app shouldn't be detecting whether if my phone has a pin number or not. This is a red flag on your digital banking system. No other bank is doing this including Trust Bank who is your competitor and they are doing better than you. Btw do not insult Singtel share holders like me.
User Interface,14,Occasional errors,"Love the function of having multiple pockets as it helps me to track each target accordingly. Thank you for the genius allocation! Would have given 4.5 if there was, with the 0.5 hoping for unlimited numbers of pockets. :"")"
User Interface,15,Occasional errors,It's seemless banking experience
User Interface,16,Delayed response,Kudos to GXS for responding promptly to the error that I experienced accessing the pockets. The latest update resolved the problem. Thank you!
User Interface,17,Confusing user interface,"Looking at past review and after installing the app, I must say the effort to launch progressively paid off instead of rushing into it. Was kind of concern if this is going to take off but I guess the objective is to ensure a safe bankng experience rather than rushing to grab the market. No observable bug and smooth sign in process."
User Interface,18,Others,Great banking app with attractive interest rates! Please allow us to add and/or save payees so we donâ€™t have to keep typing out UEN numbers or account numbers. Would be nice to be able to add the debit card to Apple Pay too!!
User Interface,19,Others,"A bank like no other, no bank have such amazing feature to separate your money into different â€œpocketsâ€ to keep track of your goals. Moreover the interest rate they give is the highest for the no effort! Interest are being deposit daily and itâ€™s amazing to see ðŸ’µ coming in to the bank daily! 

The user interfaces is so intuitive that every button can be found with your eyes close, that makes money transfer so much smoother. Also the colours is so slick that I want to turn the app on everyday just to look at it and see the daily interest

Lots of potential for the product and I canâ€™t wait to see more of it."
User Interface,20,Others,"Well if u like to see growth everyday, this app gives u that. Set goals and see it grow towards it!"
User Interface,21,Others,"Why put an app on the store when you are not ready. All about the app now is collecting info. If you have heard yet, please use testflight for ur â€˜launchâ€™ aka beta testing ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»

Update: doesnâ€™t bode wellâ€¦ even response is so robotic n mundane. Might as well not respond and spend the time to build the app for a proper launch"
User Interface,22,Others,"I have to say that the UI/UX is one of the best one Iâ€™ll have seen for any Digibank mobile app and finally a strong market player that focuses on customer experience and design, which is critical as most banking products doesnâ€™t differ much for any banks out there. Please make it available asap canâ€™t wait to see what you have to offer!"
User Interface,23,Others,"Good to see increased competition in the banking space (high interest is good, but inexplicably only given within a saving pocket), but GXS app lacks basic functionality, eg. ability to save payees (at the point of writing this review, these details need to be re-input each time - irritating and error prone). Suggest that rather than working on cool, but otherwise non-essential functions (like saving pockets), the company should focus on the basics first."
User Interface,24,Others,"Pls improve your good service for any person who are really need it,hope the app can improve soon"
User Interface,25,Others,Honestly is my first time depositing digital banking A lot worry . But at the end is a great experience. I believe a lot of us wanted is the return . And they offer very high interest. Will continue to deposit Thank you
User Interface,26,Others,"It doesnâ€™t make the company look reputable when they offer a high interest rate only to drop it immediately after gaining enough users. It feels like a bait, which it is. They should acquire deposits through more honest and transparent methods."
User Interface,27,Others,Unexpected error when trying to login. Kindly fix this issue ASAP.
User Interface,28,Others,"Fair and transparent loans.
Interest is not like the atypical bank that is out to profit and cripple the debtor."

User Interface,30,Others,"Extremely disappointed with the GXS app. Despite consistent use on the same device for a long time, it suddenly stopped allowing money transfers with explanation device changed.
