0,Inability to save payment,"My biggest frustration is that I cant save payees when sending money  Everytime I need to transfer funds I have to select a transfer type and fully type out the account number payees name and select the bank

This is incredibly tedious esp for accounts I pay frequently Without this fundamental feature a payee list its easy to make mistakes entering long account number name and bank name each time"
1,Lengthy onboarding process,Despite a lengthy onboarding but my account got approved promptly I like that the app is snappy and easy to use Waiting for credit card so that I can switch to GXS as my main account
2,Disappointment with the app,Extremely disappointed with the GXS app Despite consistent use on the same device for a long time it suddenly stopped allowing money transfers with explanation device changed This lack of clarity and abrupt disruption in service is unacceptable Terrible user experience deserves only 1 star
3,Disappointment with the app,How many attempts for the year Until now message still the same Its not you its us We understand that receiving this news may be disappointing And while were unable to disclose the specific reasons why your GXS FlexiLoan application wasnt approved please know that every GXS FlexiLoan application goes through an evaluation process that must meet our eligibility criteria and internal assessment requirements

6,Difficulty logging in,Wasnt able to log in since 7 Sept Called the CSO hotline on 9 Sept and was told to try resending the email OTP Checked the email junk box and retried multiple times but didnt receive any emails Was told that they had to check on the back end When asked when I could receive a response they mentioned 2 working days But this means I wouldnt be able to carry out any transactions for 5 whole days Imagine if I had a critical transaction to carry out I would have no access to my funds

15,Absence of certain features,Please put in option for adding Payeebeneficiary in the app We should not be typing in bank account number everytime we make a transfer
16,Absence of certain features,The links after downloading the app are unclickable to even register Looks more like a wireframe on a Marvel platform Lol What a great UX that GXS promises in their marketing but unable to deliver I wonder what happens if you cannot click in future to transfer your money I have serious doubts about how legit they are about Fintech with such a haphazard launch
17,Low interest rates,Worst rate you will ever find Bank interest are much more forgiving This app calculate and told me about 85 Perannum Total outrageous Thats close to ah long rate  Horrible horrible Straight away uninstalled
18,Low interest rates,Ssucks
19,Confusing user interface,Sleek simple to use
20,App instability,I have merely tried to apply for your flexi loan on this app But when i tried to applied like 9 times straight i have been instantly being asked to reapply over and over again Very bad for user experience and does not live up to expectations till today

26,Others,Nice design
27,Others,Gxs is simple and easy to use with a saving accountpocket that has no TnC But not being able to add payees for FAST transfer is quite a setback and detrimental considering it as a basic common banking service that most people do As a digital bank isnt it pertinent to include basic online banking service like adding of payee
28,Others,App is very responsive and interface is simple but comprehensive Transaction speeds are very quick too
29,Others,It doesnt make the company look reputable when they offer a high interest rate only to drop it immediately after gaining enough users It feels like a bait which it is They should acquire deposits through more honest and transparent methods
30,Others,Good to use

32,Others,Is GXS looking into this issue Going to be a week still something is wrong What happened to iOS user testing before roll out Its baffling the slow service recovery GXS is impressing upon iOS users
