0,User interface issues,I have to say that the UIUX is one of the best one Ill have seen for any Digibank mobile app and finally a strong market player that focuses on customer experience and design which is critical as most banking products doesnt differ much for any banks out there Please make it available asap cant wait to see what you have to offer

4,Account sign up issues,Have been waiting for a slot for the account since GXS started and have been waiting until now about 7 months and still nothing whenever anyone ask for why the excuses given are still mostly the same with no actual changes or improvements people cant help but compare to the other bank trust bank Singapore that also launched just 1 day before GXSs launch and believe trust bank Singapore to be better since trust bank can allow people to register without waiting for this long

26,Application processing issues,Just found out that they are reducing their interest rate to a pathetic 268 dont like this bait and switch marketing strategy lure us with high interest rate then suddenly drop the interest rates once they get enough sign ups Update Whats the point of increasing the main wallet interest when no one puts money there Its not like youre increasing it back to 348 right The pt is the big reduction of the Pockets interest rates which is the key thing that people arent happy about
27,Interest rate issues,I hope the GXS Bank can given the interest 10 pa as deposit 1 into the saving account as a free gift 
28,Interest rate issues,Easy to register and deposit Clean UI interface
29,Loan approval issues,Easy to apply good full amount of loan given compare to outside or lending bee  or they never cut your loan amouny  interest can be save if payment early multiple loan also can only it could be better if can increase loan amount after loan given  or can be resgistet again once deleted

47,SingPass integration issues,Im stuck on the singpass page without being able to proceed All is updated to latest ver
48,SingPass integration issues,Cannot sig up
49,SingPass integration issues,Seriously makes you wonder how grab and singtel took so long to come up with an app and there is no simple things like adding a payee The debit card was only recently released when trust came up with a proper product more than a year ago with a proper rewards programme Just like its owners GXS is a failure
50,App layout and design issues,"Why put an app on the store when you are not ready All about the app now is collecting info If you have heard yet please use testflight for ur launch aka beta testing 

Update doesnt bode well even response is so robotic n mundane Might as well not respond and spend the time to build the app for a proper launch"
51,App layout and design issues,Dumbest banking app ever Get your own people to put 5 never seen such app before if you are good then make the app good and give 348
52,App layout and design issues,Disappointing app experience awful faux friendly service I was invited to join via Grab After multiple painful attempts to sign up and v lacklustre UIUX I was told that theres been an error and finally received a vague email stating that I am ineligible without offering any reason why After multiple emails customer service still failed to explain why I am not eligible while signing off as my GXS buddy everytime I dont need a buddy from you I just need you to do your job
53,App layout and design issues,Its a simple bank app to help you save and transfer your daily needs Just dont split screen or use another app when using it
54,App layout and design issues,Fantastic Bank Great UX
55,App layout and design issues,The app works great simple yet effective enough to encourage savings via pockets so that users do not unknowingly overspent using the main account and that explain the lower interest as compared to funds kept inside the pockets Although its good to start small i do hope the bank can increase the saving caps to encourage even more savingsSecurity wise while i think is on par with industry standard but there are still room to enhance it further as scammers are getting smarter everyday
56,App layout and design issues,Apps is fast and UI is cool
57,App layout and design issues,beautiful app
58,Others,Seamless Got it up and running in less than 5mins Easy to transfer in and out from other banks I like the daily interest credit Helps me set aside money for daily use and motivates me to check how much Im getting everyday Dun understand why there are gripes and complaints from other reviewers This app is fantastic
