0,Difficulty in sending money to GXS account,"Sending money into my GXS account is a breeze and instantaneous  regardless of the amounts Im able to immediately see that my funds are in GXS 

Transferring money OUT is a huge issue Since June Ive had problems transferring amounts higher than 500 back to my other banking accounts each time a red banner will pop up and said something went wrong please try again later TODAY I cant transfer more than 1000 back to myself  even the 1000 had to be transferred in TWO transactions of 500 each Customer service officers did their best to help each time but its annoying that the advice provided killing the app relogging in with SingPass still dont work"
