14,Issues with SMS and email notifications,Already 1 year but basic functions like adding payee is not in the app Its so troublesome to transfer funds to different bank accounts With your latest move to reduce interest to 268 has made me feels like maribank is better even with slightly lower interest rate because they knows what basic functions to include in the app

20,Others,"A bank like no other no bank have such amazing feature to separate your money into different pockets to keep track of your goals Moreover the interest rate they give is the highest for the no effort Interest are being deposit daily and its amazing to see  coming in to the bank daily 

The user interfaces is so intuitive that every button can be found with your eyes close that makes money transfer so much smoother Also the colours is so slick that I want to turn the app on everyday just to look at it and see the daily interest

Lots of potential for the product and I cant wait to see more of it"
