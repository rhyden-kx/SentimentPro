0,Fast reversal during money transfer,Hit with fast reversal when transferring money to this gxs bank first time in my life a fast transfer didnt succeed Googled for recent reviews and social media on this gxs bank Mostly bad reviews and issues I dont need developer reply to my review here as Im absolutely not going to touch this bank anymore And biggest joke of all you dont even have the most basic banking feature to save payee details What kind of app development staff and quality is that
1,Difficulties with platform design,Best get back to the drawing board Design thinking  forget about the  many dumb users out there including me
2,Difficulties with platform design,Totally absurd and redundant feature that FORCES me to setup a PASSWORD FOR MY PHONE The same kind autocracy and authoritarianism they force down the throat of their delivery riders Ive got at least 3 other banking apps by major banks NONE I repeat  NONE forces me to modify my phone settings to accommodate them Im steering away from this app
3,Time wasting issues,Really really damm time wasting if not ready for sign up dont launch Close down and dont let people wait for you uninstalling now Trust Bank is much better CRAB
4,Login issues,Hang when i want to log in with sing pass
5,Login issues,Stuck on Oops something went wrong page when opening the app while overseas I cant imagine if I was in a urgent situation and my banking app failed like this No way to access funds through a browser too means you cant do anything at all other than hope the problem is fixed soon Put what you can afford to lose
6,Login issues,Cant log in and app crash
7,Account closure without notice,Closed my account without giving me any reason Just started to put money in the account to earn interest merely only earned 4 of interest in total
8,Limited savings account availability,Received email notifying savings account is available to sign up but when i tried to sign up i got rejected immediately No reason was given when rejected only show faq which does not answer my question Even after reaching out to the support email no specific reason was given I was simply told not eligible An alternative savings account I suggest would be OCBC 360 which also offer high interest rate with terms and conditions
9,Poor user experience,What a nonsense app is thisdownload but say got malware in my hpand ask me to fix my appwth
10,Poor user experience,Terrible experience Took 4 attempts to finally set up account Previous 3x received error msg couldnt approve your account at this time When the account was finally set up a few hours later the app crashed Have restarted the phone uninstalled and reinstalled the app Im still stuck at the first page after logging in which seemed to have a popped up msgad but not loading Then the error msg of app is not responding appeared and prompted me to close the app
11,Poor user experience,5000 limit Big L
12,Poor user experience,Can not download yet just always show pending
13,Poor user experience,Its doesnt work theyre just trying to collect phone numbers If theyre not ready for people to download and use it it shouldnt be on the play store
14,Biometric authentication problems,Unable to use biometrics
15,Reduced interest rates for savings,first bank to reduce interest rates for savings but interest rates for loans stay high
16,Slow registration process with SingPass,forces you to use singpass to register is slow when browsing the FAQs and the login doesnt allow singpassbased password login when the registration does maximum frustration

21,Others,
22,Others,Rates are not so attractive already
23,Others,Problem solved am happily using it
24,Others,is there a login issue now
25,Others,Like this app over Trust and others Concept similar to Timo bank in VN which I used before when I was living there 5k account limit is shocking to me since these days where got people only save 5k Hope for an update on this asap as well as debit card Otherwise interface is clean easy to use easy to sign up good interest rate For now gxs looks promising to be my permanent savings bank Others will just serve as my Spent account or salary credit account
26,Others,Garbage company for deceiving the public
