0,Inability to save payments,"My biggest frustration is that I can‚Äôt save payees when sending money.  Everytime I need to transfer funds, I have to select a transfer type and fully type out the account number, payee‚Äôs name, and select the bank.

This is incredibly tedious esp for accounts I pay frequently. Without this ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù feature a payee list, it‚Äôs easy to make mistakes entering long account number, name and bank name each time."
1,Issues with GXS apps linked to Grab app,Like to use GXS apps that is link to Grabs apps for easy to transfer money from saving to topup Grabs account.
2,Receiving email invites from GXS,"Received email invite from GXS saying that I am now able to open an account. After finishing the entire onboarding application I am told they are unable to proceed with my application saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs us‚Äù. 

Ummmm okayyyy"

31,Digital savings bank account issues,Its a simple bank app to help you save and transfer your daily needs. Just dont split screen or use another app when using it.
32,Digital savings bank account issues,"If you not ready, dont waste everbody's time and effort to install your app! Before launch your app rating is 2.5, you guys are really clueless! (Dec.20) - they opened my Saving Account with cap of $5K, are you kidding me? Running a bank or school project?"
33,Digital savings bank account issues,"If your bank is not ready for the public, you shouldn't even shout out you are ready. Unlike Trust, you download the app and they are really to accept application sign up. Super disappointed and how to trust my fund with your organisation?"

44,Others,"Received email notifying savings account is available to sign up, but when i tried to sign up, i got rejected immediately. No reason was given when rejected, only show faq which does not answer my question. Even after reaching out to the support email, no specific reason was given. I was simply told not eligible. An alternative savings account I suggest would be OCBC 360, which also offer high interest rate with terms and conditions."
45,Others,Cannot open the apps. Why partner with Grab? Useless app
46,Others,"An absolutely rubbish apps, with zero chance of getting loan approval, totally useless"
